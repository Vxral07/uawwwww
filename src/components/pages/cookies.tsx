                        Technical information, including the Internet protocol

                        system, as well as the admin system and aggregated data
                        reports. That data is statistical in nature and tells us
                        about the navigational behaviour and actions of our
                        users and does not divulge any information about the

                        interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and
                        mouse-overs); and • In addition, we may use third party
                        services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor

                        information such as gender, country of provenance and
                        age. Navigational Behaviour may include information such
                        as pages viewed during a session, time spent on a given
                        page and engagement with the Site's content such as
